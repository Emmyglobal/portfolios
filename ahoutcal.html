        Design Concept: Home Mortgage Calculator
    1. Purpose:
    This calculator will help users forecast their monthly mortgage payments and the overall cost of a home loan. It will allow users to experiment with different loan terms, interest rates, and down payments to find the most affordable and suitable option for their financial situation.
    
    2. Platform:
    A responsive web app designed to work seamlessly on both desktops and mobile devices. The interface will be optimized for touch inputs, making it user-friendly on tablets and smartphones.
    
    3. User Interface Elements:
    
    Input Fields:
    
    Home Price: A text box where the user enters the cost of the home.
    Down Payment: A text box or percentage slider to specify the down payment amount.
    Loan Term: A dropdown menu to select the term length (e.g., 15, 20, 30 years).
    Interest Rate: A text box to input the annual interest rate (APR).
    Property Taxes: Optional text box to enter annual property tax rate or use a default setting.
    Homeowner's Insurance: Optional text box for annual insurance costs.
    PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance): A checkbox to indicate if PMI is needed and an optional input for the rate.
    Buttons:
    
    Calculate: A prominent button to initiate the calculation.
    Clear: To reset all fields to their default values.
    Advanced Options: An expandable section that includes additional customization options like extra payments, bi-weekly payments, etc.
    Output Fields:
    
    Monthly Payment: Displays the total monthly payment including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance.
    Total Cost of Loan: Shows the total amount paid over the loan term.
    Amortization Schedule: An expandable section displaying a breakdown of payments over time.
    4. Visual Design:
    
    Color Scheme:
    Use calming colors like blues and greens to create a trustworthy and professional look. Highlight important numbers in bold or with a contrasting color (e.g., dark blue or green for the monthly payment).
    
    Layout:
    A clean, minimalist layout with clearly labeled sections. The input fields are arranged logically from top to bottom or left to right, depending on the device orientation. The "Calculate" button is large and easy to find, while the output fields are immediately below or next to it for quick visibility.
    
    Feedback:
    Instant visual feedback when a user enters data incorrectly, such as a red border around an invalid input field with an error message.
    
    5. Additional Features:
    
    Graphical Output:
    An optional graph showing how payments are distributed over time between principal and interest.
    
    Save/Share:
    Options to save the calculation as a PDF or share it via email or social media.
    
    Localization:
    The ability to change currency symbols, date formats, and language settings.
